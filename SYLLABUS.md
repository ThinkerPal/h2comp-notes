# The H2 Computing (9569) Syllabus

The following is a breakdown of topics that the syllabus covers, split by where things are tested (eg. theory vs practical). This is taken directly from the y22_9569 syllabus document available on SEAB's website [here](https://www.seab.gov.sg/docs/default-source/national-examinations/syllabus/alevel/2022syllabus/9569_y22_sy.pdf) (for now, anyways)

Temporarily, it is sorted by how it is in the syllabus document. to be updated.

## The Practical
### Algorithms and Data Structures 
- Implement the following sorting algorithms:
    - Bubble Sort 
    - Insertion Sort
    - Quicksort
    - Mergesort
- Implment the following search algorithms:
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search
    - Hash table Search

### Programming
- Keep in mind the following while writing code:
    - Use identation and white space (I mean the syllabus is literally in Python so its _kind of_ hard to avoid using indentataion)
        - Be mindful of spacing out code, especially if dealing with functions and the like.
    - Use good naming convetions.
    - Write comments!!
- Understand and use  different "primitive" data types
    - `integer`, `char`, `string`, `boolean`, `lists` (both 1 and 2-dimesional arrays) 
- Use standard library functions:
    - Input/Output (to standard input/output as well as to files)
    - String methods
    - Mathematical Operations
- Understand and implement the following to control your program's flow (in other words, how your porgram works)
    - TODO: WHAT IS THIS
    - Sequence
    - Selection
    - Iteration 
- Make and use functions
- Undertand and implement recursion
- Understand how to use stacks in recursive programmes


## The Theory Paper
### Algorithms and Data Structures 
- Use appropriate technieuqes (eg. psuedo-code, flowcharts) to show program flow
- Use standard flowchart symbols (Just look at Microsoft Word/Google Docs') standard flowchart symbols - those will work
- Use decision tables to explore actions for combinations of different input conditions
- Explain how sorting/search algorithms work
- Compare and describle the efficencies of search and sort algorithms using Big-O notation
- Understand the concept of static and dynamic allocation of memory
- Create, Insert and Delete elements in a stack and queue (both linear and circular)
- Create, Insert, Search and Delete elements for a linear linked-list and binary search tree
- Understand pre-order, in-order and post-order tree traversals, and how in-order tree traversal works for BSTs

### Programming
