# H2 Computing Notes

Welcome! This repo includes notes that I'm making for revision, but hopefully you'd find them useful to!

Updates may be spoardic, but if there's a particular topic that you'd like me to detail (in the event that the year is not 2022 and I've already graduated and hence have no need check on this), feel free to open an Issue!

## Some notes about the environment

Despite the year being 2022, we are still using a Python 3.6 environment, so newer features like your fancy switch cases are not available. Yes, I know Python 3.6 EOLed in the end of 2021, but I don't make the decisions here. Oops.
